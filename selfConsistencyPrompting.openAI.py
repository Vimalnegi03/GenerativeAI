Solve the following math problem carefully:

Problem: {user_question}

- Think about it in at least 5 different ways.
- For each way, explain your reasoning step-by-step.
- Then, based on your different ways, choose the most common final answer.
- Clearly state the final result at the end.

Only output the final answer at the end in format: Final Answer: <your answer>
